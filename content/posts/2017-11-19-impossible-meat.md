Today I finally made it to Clover to try out their Impossible Meat offering. It really exceeded expectations; it tastes just like real meat. If anything, there is a _slight_ difference in texture.

According to Wired[^1] the “meat” achieves a similar taste profile by including _heme_:

> Impossible Foods thinks the essence of a meat lies in a compound called heme, which gives ground beef its color and vaguely metallic taste—thanks to iron in the heme molecule. In blood, heme lives in a protein called hemoglobin; in muscle, it's in myoglobin.
