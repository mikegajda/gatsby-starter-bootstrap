  Zero-waste evangelists talk about their “journey” to a new way of living and shopping. Katerina Bogatireva, who opened Precycle in Brooklyn in December, took her first steps when she tried, and only partially succeeded, to reduce the trash she and her young son produced. “It was difficult to shop. You had to buy one thing here, one thing there,” she said. “And then there were the snacks. Try telling your 6-year-old that he can’t have a fig bar because it’s wrapped in plastic.”
