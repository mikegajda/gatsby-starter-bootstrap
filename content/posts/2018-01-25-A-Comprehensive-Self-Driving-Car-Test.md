Such a test makes sense to me:

> Every few years, I have to pass a test from the Department of Motor Vehicles to drive my car in Virginia (and the rest of the U.S.). Shouldn't a self-driving car be required to do the same thing? Actually, the Waymo self-driving car passes a more comprehensive set of tests than humans do, as I found out after asking about its safety report.
