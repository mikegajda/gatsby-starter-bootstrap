> Fashion brands have relied on increasingly less expensive material from low-quality polyester to cheap cotton. Of course, since the clothes are designed to be obsolete after a few wears, it doesn’t matter if they will fall apart quickly. There are many other pollution problems, like coloring fabrics using toxic dyes, or tanning leather using toxic chemicals. But perhaps the most problematic part of all is that, as consumers, we’re cycling through more clothes than we need, partly because they’re designed to fall apart quickly, and partly because they’re so cheap, it’s worth making room in our closets for new items.

It's definitely a goal of mine to be more conscious of making sustainable choices when it comes to clothing though sometimes this is difficult when stores like Uniqlo push you buy buy buy.
