> Let’s all pump the brakes. The Patriots played a terrible game on both sides of the ball, and the coaching also wasn’t great. But that doesn’t mean this is going to be a lost season. Remember what the Patriots looked like opening night last year? They were run off the field by the Chiefs. They looked as though they would be noncompetitive all season. They finished the season 12-4 and lost in the Super Bowl.
