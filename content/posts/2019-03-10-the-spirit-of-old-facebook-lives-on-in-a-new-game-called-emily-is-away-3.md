excerpt: Facebook as we know it is on its way out as the company eyes a so-called pivot to privacy, but its legacy lives on. Developer Kyle Seeley — creator of AIM-based visual novels Emily is Away and Emily is Away Too — is working on a new game that aims to recapture the spirit of Facebook in its heyday. Called Emily is Away <3, Seeley’s latest game will let players create a “Facenook” account, send friend requests, and enjoy angsty ambiguous statuses.
