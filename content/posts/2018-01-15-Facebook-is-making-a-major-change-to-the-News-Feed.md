As my challenge for this month, I’ve deleted the Facebook app from my phone. Now, my only access is through the web, and the experience has been revitalizing. I didn’t realize how much time I spent aimlessly scrolling through the app. I think this is a step in the right direction, but I don’t know if Facebook will be able to pull it off.
